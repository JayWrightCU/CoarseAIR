           COMPILATION and INSTALLATION
    ==========================================
    
  !!! CMAKE ver must be > 3.5

  !!! Required environmenatal variables:
      - FC, Flag for Fortran Compiler (gfortran/ifort)
      - GSL_DIR, GSL_INC and GSL_LIB (old version of Arrhenius was working only with gsl ver < 1.15; now it should work with any ver)
      - OBLAS_LIB and OBLAS_INC        (IF RUNNING ON THOR)
      - WORKSPACE_PATH, with the path to WORKSPACE folder (E.g.: /home/venturi/WORKSPACE)


  - Clone the "CoarseAIR" directory in the WORSKPACE;

       |      |___ coarseair

       |             |___ ...
       |
       |___ ...
         

  - From the coarseair folder (cd ./CoarseAIR/coarseair), source BuildingInstalling.sh by typing "source ./scripts/building/BuildingInstalling.sh”;
  
  
  - From the coarseair folder, update CoarseAIR's enveiromental variables by typing "COARSEAIR_debug" or "COARSEAIR_release", based on the preferred CoarseAIR distribution;


  - Type the command “COARSEAIR_INSTALL” for building and installing the CoarseAIR code.



                    EXECUTION
    ========================================
 
  - Create a “Run” directory inside CoarseAIR
  
      CoarseAIR
        |
        |____ build
        |
        |____ coarseair
        |
        |____ install
        |
        |____ Run
			                          
	
  - Copy the "input" folder inside the run directory (from CoarseAIR, "scp -r ./coarseair/input/#System#/input ./Run", where #System# 
      refers to the name of the chemical system of interest) and modify the input files inside the folder.
        (N.B.: Change the Database Path in ./Run/input/CoarseAIR.inp)


  - For running the code:

	    - Copy the bash file inside the Run directory (scp -r ./coarseair/scripts/launching/CoarseAIR.sh ./Run).

	    - Modify the bash file by changing the number of processors.
	        (N.B.: If the number of nodes is larger than 1, .pbs will be automatically created and submitted.)

  	    - Type the command for uploading the compiler (“CoarseAIR_release” or “CoarseAIR_release”).

	    - Execute the bash file from the Run directory ("cd ./Run; bash CoarseAIR.sh").

  	    
  	    
  	             POSTPROCESSING
    ========================================
    
    - Create a “Postprocessing” directory inside CoarseAIR/Run
    
    - Copy there the MATLAB postprocessing (main) file (scp CoarseAIR/coarseair/scripts/postprocessing/PostCGQCT/Exec/PostCGQCT.m COARSEAIR/Run/Postprocessing).
    
        CoarseAIR
            |
            |____ build
            |
            |____ coarseair
            |
            |____ install
            |
            |____ Run
                    |
                    |____ input
                    |
                    |____ Test
                    |
                    |____ CoarseAIR.sh
                    |
                    |____ Postprocessing
                          |
                          |____ PostCGQCT.m
                          
                          
    - If this is the first time you are using MATLAB postprocessing for CoarseAIR, add (with subfolders) the path to CoarseAIR/coarseair/scripts/postprocessing/PostCGQCT
      (From MATLAB's home, go to "Set Path")
      
    - Check if the chemical system you want to run is present in CoarseAIR/coarseair/scripts/postprocessing/PostCGQCT/input/UpdateAllInput.m. If not, modify such file.
    
    - Change the input parameters in PostCGQCT.m and run it.
