### IN ORDER TO GENERATE LEVELS:

	1 - Create a running folder (ex. mkdir /CoarseAIR/run_N3/), with an input folder inside 
		(ex. mkdir /CoarseAIR/run_N3/input/)

	2 - Copy the CoarseAIR.inp and GenerateLevels.inp files in the input folder from /CoarseAIR/coarseair/input/
		(ex. scp /CoarseAIR/coarseair/input/N3/input/CoarseAIR.inp /CoarseAIR/run_N3/input)

	3 - Modify the GenerateLevels.inp file

	4 - Modify the CoarseAIR.inp file; in particular:
			- Generating Energy Levels? = yes
			- System = ...
			- Nb of Species = ...
				Species 1 = ...
			- Nb of Molecules = ...
				Molecule 1 = ...
				Nb of Atoms, Molecule 1 = ...
				Diatomic Potential Model, Molecule 1 = ...
			- Nb of Atoms = ...
			  	Atom 1 = ...
			  	Mass [a.u.] of Atom 1  = ...
		  	- Database Path = ... (path to /CoarseAIR/coarseair/dtb/)

  	5 - Copy the CoarseAIR.sh running script from /CoarseAIR/coarseair/scripts/launching/CoarseAIR.sh
  		(ex. scp /CoarseAIR/coarseair/scripts/launching/CoarseAIR.sh /CoarseAIR/run_N3/)

	6 - Modify the CoarseAIR.sh file; in particular:
			- NNode=1 (Multiple-node runs not implemented yet)                                                                                          
			- NProc=...

	7 - Update libraries by typing COARSEAIR_UPDATE from the terminal;
		Choose release/debug version (ex. type COARSEAIR_release from the terminal)

	8 - From the running folder, execute the CoarseAIR.sh script 
		(ex. cd /CoarseAIR/run_N3/; bash CoarseAIR.sh)

	9 - Once the computation is done, sort the levels using the matlab script /CoarseAIR/coarseair/scripts/preprocessing/SortLevelsByEnergy.m
		(paths to the level files need to be changed before running the script)
	
       10 - Move the resulting file in the proper folder in the dtb 
	    	(ex. mv /CoarseAIR/run_N3/Test/N3/N2/N2_Temp.inp /CoarseAIR/coarseair/dtb/N3/N2/)
