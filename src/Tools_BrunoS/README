All these files are very old version of files include in my Fortran Package (ForPack).
Old version are required in order to compile the code with gfortran, whcih does not support F03/F08 stuffs.
I made many quick and dirty fixs in the sources so that these files could be compiled with gfortran.
Also, submodules are only supported in the lastest version of cmake, so I removed them.cd ../
